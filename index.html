<h1><b><i>The Jagadguru Shankaracharya Of Sringeri</i></b> </h1>

<p style="color:red">In a world that Changes all the time <p>
<p>.One thing remains the same -our pursult of happiness and desire to avoid Suffering.</p>
<p>The sages of Sanatana Dharma (or Hinduisu as it is called today) have always taught us that the</p>
<p>philosophy of the Upanishads and other texts the Bhagavad gita are our path to lasting happiness.</p>
<p>Formost among our sages is Sri Adhi Shanakaracharya.</p>
<p>Who lived 1200 years ago and is credited with reviving Sanatana Dharma.</p>
<p>He established four corners of India, of which the Sri Sharada Peetham at Sringeri is the frist and most important.</p>
<p>This peetham is blessed with an unbroken  imeage of eminent Jagadgurus that stretches directly back to Sri Adi Shankaracharya himself.</p>
<p>Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji is the current and 36<sup>th</sup>Jagadguru of this ancient 
<p>lineage and exemlifies the God-realization of the Upanishadic sages.</p>
<p>He is both a direct  link to Sanatana Dharma’s glorious past and the torch bearer to ensure that Upanishandic</p> 
<p>sages.where was he born and what was his childhood like? How did his divinity express itself? How did he meet his Guru?</p> 
<p>What made his Guru anoint him as his Successor? Why is his life relevant to us and what can we learn from it?</p>
<p>Through interviews with ordinary devotees,</p>
<p>Scholars and sanyasis, we discover how the <b slyle="color:blue" font-size:36px;"><i>Mahaswamiji</i></b></center>
practices the essential virtues of humility, 
<blockquote>compassion, unconditional giving and kindness.</p>
<p>While scholars extol his great knowledge, spiritual seekers off all kinds (young and old alike ) are carefully guided by him on the path of Sanatana Dharma.</p>
<p>By his personal example and his teachings, <the Mahaswamiji demon strates how the core tenets of sanatana Dharma  can help us lead a balances. Meaningful and happy life even in today’s busy world</p></blockquote>
