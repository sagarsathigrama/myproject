               The Jagadguru Shankaracharya Of Sringeri

In a world that Changes all the time .One thing remains the same -our pursult of happiness and desire to avoid Suffering. The sages of Sanatana Dharma (or Hinduisu as it is called today) have always taught us that the philosophy of the Upanishads and other texts the Bhagavad gita are our path to lasting happiness.
Formost among our sages is Sri Adhi Shanakaracharya. Who lived 1200 years ago and is credited with reviving Sanatana Dharma. He established four corners of India, of which the Sri Sharada Peetham at Sringeri is the frist and most important. This peetham is blessed with an unbroken  imeage of eminent Jagadgurus that stretches directly back to Sri Adi Shankaracharya himself.
Sri Bharati Tirtha Mahaswamiji is the current and 36th  Jagadguru of this ancient lineage and exemlifies the God-realization of the Upanishadic sages. He is both a direct  link to Sanatana Dharma’s glorious past and the torch bearer to ensure that Upanishandic sages.where was he born and what was his childhood like? How did his divinity express itself? How did he meet his Guru? What made his Guru anoint him as his Successor? Why is his life relevant to us and what can we learn from it?
Through interviews with ordinary devotees, Scholars and sanyasis, we discover how thw Mahaswamiji practices the essential virtues of humility, compassion, unconditional giving and kindness. While scholars extol his great knowledge, spiritual seekers off all kinds (young and old alike ) are carefully guided by him on the path of Sanatana Dharma. By his personal example and his teachings, the Mahaswamiji demon strates how the core tenets of sanatana Dharma  can help us lead a balances.
